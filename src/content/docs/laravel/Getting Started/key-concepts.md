## MVC Architecture

- Laravel follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which separates the application logic into three main components: Models, Views, and Controllers.
- **Model:**</span> Represents the data and business logic.
- **View:**</span> Handles the presentation and user interface.
- **Controller:**</span> Manages the flow between the model and the view.

## Routing 

- Laravel's routing system is straightforward and flexible, allowing developers to define routes to handle different HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.).
- Routes can be defined using closures or controller methods.

## Eloquent ORM

- Eloquent is Laravel's powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool, which simplifies database interactions.
- It allows developers to work with database objects and relationships using an expressive syntax, avoiding complex SQL queries.



## Blade Templating Engine
 

- Blade is Laravel's templating engine, providing a simple yet powerful way to create views.
- It supports template inheritance and includes features like loops, conditional statements, and escaping.
## Artisan Console: 

- Artisan is Laravel's command-line interface (CLI), offering various built-in commands for common tasks like database migrations, running tests, and generating boilerplate code.

##  Middleware

- Middleware is a way to filter HTTP requests entering your application. It can be used for authentication, logging, and other tasks.
- Middleware can be applied globally or to specific routes.

## Service Container
- Laravel's service container is a powerful tool for managing class dependencies and performing dependency injection.
- It facilitates the binding of interfaces to concrete implementations and resolving dependencies automatically.

## Database Migrations
- Migrations provide a version control system for the database schema, allowing you to define and manage your database structure using PHP code.
- They help in evolving the database schema without losing data and keep the schema consistent across different environments.

## Queue System
- Laravel provides a robust queue system for deferring the processing of time-consuming tasks, such as sending emails or processing files, to a background job.
- This helps in improving application performance and user experience.

## Authentication and Authorization
- Laravel offers built-in support for user authentication and authorization.
- It includes features like login, registration, password reset, and roles/permissions management.


## RESTful Controllers
- Laravel simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs with resourceful controllers, which map CRUD operations to HTTP verbs like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

## Event-Driven Development
- Laravel supports event-driven programming, allowing developers to define and listen for events within the application.
- This is useful for decoupling different parts of the application and executing certain actions in response to specific events.

## Testing
- Laravel has built-in support for unit and feature testing, making it easier to write and run tests for your application.
- It includes PHPUnit as a testing framework and offers various tools and helpers to facilitate testing.

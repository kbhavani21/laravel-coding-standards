title: Implement the down() Migration method
---

Most developers often overlook implementing the 
<span class=" text-[13px] bg-[#EDEEF3] px-2 py-1 ">down()</span> method in their migration file. This neglect can have significant consequences, particularly in successfully executing rollbacks. Therefore, it is a highly recommended Laravel best practice to always implement the down() method for every up() method in your migration file.

title: Use the down() method correctly for rollbacks
---
The down() (used by the php artisan migrate:rollback command) is ran when you need to rollback changes you made to your database.

Some people use it, some donâ€™t.

If you belong to the people who use it, you should make sure your <font color="green">down()</font> method is implemented correctly.

Basically, the<font color="green">down()</font> method must do the opposite of the <font color="green">up()</font> method.

    use IlluminateSupportFacadesSchema;
    use IlluminateDatabaseSchemaBlueprint;
    use IlluminateDatabaseMigrationsMigration;

    return new class extends Migration {
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::table('posts', function (Blueprint $table) {
            // The column was a boolean, but we want to switch to a datetime.
            $table->datetime('is_published')->nullable()->change();
        });
    }

    public function down()
    {
        Schema::table('posts', function (Blueprint $table) {
            // When rolling back, we have to restore the column to its previous state.
            $table->boolean('is_published')->default(false)->change();
        });
    }
}


A middleware can be attached to any number of routes, which helps you prevent code duplication.

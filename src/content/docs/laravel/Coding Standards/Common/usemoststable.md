title: Always use the most stable release
---

The most recent version of Laravel, Laravel 11.x, was released on March 12th, 2024. This new release includes some important updates, which can be found here. These updates include:

Opt-in API and broadcast routing: Before version 11, when you created a new Laravel project, it set up the API and broadcast routing. But for the Laravel 11, these routings are optional and can be added using the artisan command:

        php artisan install:api
        php artisan install:broadcasting

Make sure to follow the new process and steps outlined in the release documentation.

Simplified base controller class: The AuthorizesRequests and ValidatesRequests traits have been removed. If you need them, youâ€™ll have to manually add them. Also, the base Controller class no longer extends the Laravel internal Controller class.

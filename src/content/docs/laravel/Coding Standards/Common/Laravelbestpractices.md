title:  Additional Laravel best practices to keep in mind

---

Apart from the Laravel best practices discussed above, there are additional practices that improve your codebase readability and maintainability. These practices include:
## Laravel API best practices

-   Use middleware to implement authorization and permission for your API endpoints. This gives your codebase centralized control and improves scalability.

-   Adopt API versioning so that you can maintain various versions of your endpoints and introduce updates without interfering with existing integrations.

-   Model serialization should be done using Eloquent's API resources, which comply with Laravel API response best practices. This provides an effective and maintainable approach to managing API response, giving you more control and a reusable solution.

## Laravel project structure best practices

-   Adhere to the Laravel Directory Structure. This allows you to find and debug your application easily.

-   Implement modularization by breaking down large applications into smaller, manageable modules to improve maintainability and scalability.

## Laravel controller best practices

-   Use the controller's constructor to inject dependencies. This allows you to easily manage dependencies and improveUse Laravel's resource controllers to define RESTful routes and methods for CRUD operations, promoting clean and predictable API endpoints when necessary.

-   Inject dependencies into your controllers instead of directly instantiating them. This promotes decoupling, making your code more testable and flexible.

## Laravel cache best practice

-   Employ cache tags and cache invalidation strategies to manage cached data effectively and prevent stale or outdated information.

-   One of Laravel's REST API best practices involves caching regularly accessed data, which doesn't change often. This reduces the database data retrieval overhead.

## Laravel testing best practices

-   Implement integration tests to verify interactions between different parts of your application, including database operations, API requests, and external service integrations.

-   Structure your tests using the <a>Arrange-Act-Assert</a> (AAA) pattern. This promotes readability and maintainability.
